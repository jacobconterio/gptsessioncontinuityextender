# GPTSessionContinuityExtender

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Jacob, and this is my first github project. The goal of this project is to develop a tool that compresses, stores, and manages chat sessions efficiently. This tool is designed to help users and GPT-based assistants maintain context across sessions, reducing the need to manually explain previous conversations.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- Serializing and compressing chat data.
- Storing compressed data in an internal database.
- Providing a user-friendly interface for interaction.
- Enabling GPT-based assistants to access past sessions seamlessly, improving continuity and user experience.
- Automatically identifying and categorizing topics within chat sessions.
- Implementing security measures to ensure the privacy of stored sessions.
- Developing efficient data retrieval mechanisms to quickly access past sessions.
- Creating a robust error-handling system to manage unexpected inputs.
- Integrating machine learning techniques to enhance session retrieval accuracy.
- Designing a scalable architecture to handle large volumes of chat data.
- Implementing a backup and recovery system to prevent data loss.
- Developing a synchronization feature to keep session data consistent across devices.
- Providing detailed logging and analytics to monitor the toolâ€™s performance.
- Ensuring compatibility with various GPT models and platforms.
- Offering customization options for users to tailor the tool to their needs.

## Getting Started

More details will be added as the project progresses. Stay tuned!
